Description: Call GDAL's utilies using simple system calls and file paths. It 
             adds suppors for gdal_callc (which is missing from similar 
             packages), it is magrittr-friendly (by re-ordering functions 
             arguments and using temporal as outputs) and to some extent, 
             tidy-verse friendly.
