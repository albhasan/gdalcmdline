Title: Yet another R wrapper for GDAL's utilities
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: c(person('Alber', 'Sanchez', email = "alber.ipia@inpe.com", role = c("aut", "cre")),
             person('Rolf', 'Simoes', role = c('aut'), email = 'rolf.simoes@inpe.br'))
Description: Call GDAL's utilies using simple system calls and file paths. It 
             adds suppors for gdal_callc (which is missing from similar 
             packages), it is magrittr-friendly (by re-ordering functions 
             arguments and using temporal as outputs) and to some extent, 
             tidy-verse friendly.
